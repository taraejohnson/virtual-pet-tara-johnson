Virtual Pet Application

A virtual pet dragon the user is able to interact with when prompted for input.

User is able to name pet.

Pet begins game with set hunger level, boredom level, thirst level, and energy level.
User can choose to feed pet, play with pet, give pet something to drink, let pet rest, or abandon the pet (quit the game).

User is able to choose what to feed pet, how to play with pet, what to give the pet to drink, and how long to let pet rest.
Each choice has a greater or lesser effect on pet's status levels.

A tick method automatically decreases status levels with each loop iteration, ensuring the pet will always have needs for the user to meet.

Since dragons are mystical creatures, the dragon will not die if any status levels reach zero. 
The user must choose to abandon the pet to exit the game.
